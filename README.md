# 5-Day-Weather-Dashboard

## Summary

This is a Javascript, HTML and CSS app using the Open Weather Map API to display 5 day weather forecast for selected cities based on user input. I have used a form to allow the useer to search for cities. When they do, they are presented with current and future weather conditions for the next 5 days. that city is then added to the search history along with it's weather conditions including temp, wind speed and humidity. The bulk of the prject is using Javascript and just a bit of HTML with Bootstrap for styling.
